                    fold a paper airplane. I worked at a summer camp and many kids do not have great fine-motor skills.
                    They also do not always know where to place their fingers. This issue is what made me think of the
                    colored dots. I also thought about how kids are very visual. I decided that less words and more
                    images would be better.</h4>

                    work together to research, brainstorm, problem solve to create and present a physical prototype of
                    our solution. We were encouraged to use reused or recyclable materials. We wanted to create a
                    product that would improve the mental health of any individual. Our main goal was to focus on the
                    users throughout the design process. We wanted to do this by making it accessible, functional, and
                    innovative. Throughout the project we followed the “Critical Making” Concept; Ideation,
                    Understanding, Inspiration, Making and Sharing.

                        this process, we researched various social issues and decided to choose a social issue that
                        is relevant to our society and resonated with us. After, we chose mental health as our
                        targeted social issue and then, did some more research on the topic.

                        When coming up with the final idea, all the group members built upon each other's ideas and
                        concepts. We first came up with an idea inspired by fortune cookies. Our product would be
                        similar but instead, the messages would be positive and the cookie recipes would be different.
                        Instead
                        of getting the product at a restaurant, they could be easily obtained in schools and workplaces.
                        We
                        used google drawings to make rough sketches of our ideas as well as improve and add to the
                        original main concept. By the end of our session, we had a product concept with the name “PACs”;
                        Positive
                        Affirmation Cookies. A “PAC” is a small box that has a few cookies in it, two different positive
                        messages and a mental health phone line. People can get them in a weekly package, larger box or
                        individually from a dispenser. Buyers are encouraged to share positive messages with others. All
                        additional profits go to the Canadian Mental Health Association.

                        be an inefficient use of materials as the smaller boxes were created in such a way that they did

                        This project taught me about designing for a social issue. Having empathy for a diverse set of
                        users
                        is important. I also learned about designing in a group setting; it is important to make use of

                        leading me through the various aspects of design. There is a lot that can be learned through the
                        communication of knowledge and hands-on experience but, there is so much that can be gained when
                        these two types of learning come together as they did during this project.</h4>

                    the original purpose of a box. We were allowed to choose any type of box. The design had to be
                    creative, functional, and ergonomic. Students were encouraged to use recycled materials to create a
                    prototype illustrating the concept.

                        First, we thought of various boxes. We brainstormed ideas and decided to go with a delivery box.
                        Then, we defined and learned about the users. We grouped them into three main categories;
                        shippers, delivery people and receivers. Then we researched the main pain points that these
                        users experience. The main issues with package delivery are, damaged products in shipment, lost
                        or stolen packages and incorrect package delivery locations.

                        We brainstormed and drew various ideas on paper and in google drawings. During this, we were
                        able to build and form our design. Our final concept “hacked” the typical delivery box as it had
                        handles that could also be used as backpack straps and a bright red zipper. These made the box
                        conceptually and physically easier to use. The box had compartments and padding preventing items
                        from breaking. The concept also included a tracker connected to an app. The tracker and app let
                        users know the location of the box. This would help prevent lost, stolen, and mis-delivered
                        boxes.

                        the design through conversations and personal thought. This cycle then continues as the project
                        develops (Ratto 253). Throughout the project, we collectively gathered ideas, materials, and
                        produced a prototype. We reflected on our creation before, during, and after the “Show and Tell”
                        period. This process contributed to my growth as a designer by allowing me to gain more hands-on
                        design experience.
